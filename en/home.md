### Introducing Myself
My name is Peaksol. I am a senior high school student, busy with my study.

My favorite game is Minecraft, which I've been playing for more than six years. I'm fond of Minecraft PvP and Redstone, and I make cool Minecraft videos from time to time.

Programming is one of my hobbies. I found myself interested in programming a few years ago and started doing that then. PHP, which I have been coding in for two years, is my primary programming language. I also code in Java but can not use it reasonably well. You can see all my projects [here](/en/projects.md) or on my GitHub.


### About the Website
This is my own little spot on the Internet, however as of yet I haven't thought of anything interesting to put on it. Everything on the website is in the sidebar as you can see.

If you just want to stop by for a chat, I'm also happy to do that on my [Discord](https://aka.peaksol.fun/discord) or [QQ Group](https://aka.peaksol.fun/qq).
