# Get to know me...
Hello, there! I am **Peaksol**, a random developer. I don't like spending much time on a README file so here I am making it simple about what I am doing:
- Creating Bukkit (and somehow PocketMine) plugins
- Frontend and backend Web development
- Making bots that run on Discord and QQ
- Coding some random stuff

And here are some of the programming languages that I use for my projects:

Take a quick look at [my homepage](https://peaksol.fun/), and learn more about me and what I am doing!
