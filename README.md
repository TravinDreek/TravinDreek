# Hello There
I'm Peaksol. I'm a student and have just entered high school recently.<br>
A few years ago, I found myself interested in programming and started to learn it by myself then. So far, I've made lots of progress on it.<br>
I love playing Minecraft as well, that's why most of my projects are about Minecraft as you can see.
