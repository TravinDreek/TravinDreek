# Hello There
I am **Peaksol**, a senior high school student. A few years ago, I found myself interested in programming and started to learn it by myself. So far, I've made lots of progress on it.

I love playing Minecraft, and that's why most of my projects are about it as you can see. Take a quick look at [my homepage](https://peaksol.fun/), and learn more about me and what I am doing!
